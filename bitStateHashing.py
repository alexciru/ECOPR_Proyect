# Description:
# In this class we will be storing the information about if a state has been already visited. We will
# store this information in a File and we will decide in which position belongs to a particular state
# using a hashing function.
# 
# We will using a 16bit for the hashing function, and we will be using 2*16 = 65.535 position
